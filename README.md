## User Stories

As a user
I want to know when I can pick up my order,
because I am busy,
because I don't want to waste my time ordering my food in person and waiting for my order,
I would like to walk in and out with my order right away,
I would also like to get a reminder when I should pick up my order.

Given that I made an order to pick up,
I receive a text confirming the local time to pick up,
Using an Iphone allows me to setup a quick reminder just from the text I have recived,
and with that I can best decide when to leave the house.


As a user
I want to make sure I made the proper order,
sometimes I forget some items that I would like,

Given that I made an order and submitted it,
When I get to the orders page I can double check my cart before confirming it,
Then I know I have not missed anything.


As a Restaurant owner,
I want to check the orders that have been ordered,

Given that I can check all orders made to me via the admins page,
When an order has been picked up,
I can confirm it with a click of a button and remove it from the page.
